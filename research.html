<h4 class="panel-title"><a href="#collapse1" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> What is Digital Humanities (DH)?</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">Digital Humanities or DH is a novel interdisciplinary field where several disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, literary and cultural studies, sociology, geography, new media studies, cinema studies intersect, and collaborate with each other. In this emergent interdisciplinary field, scholars try to use computational and mathematical means to solve humanities and social science problems often intrinsic to their own disciplines.</div>

</div>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h4 class="panel-title"><a href="#collapse2" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> Why should I pursue a degree in Digital Humanities?</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">As a new domain of research, DH poses many positive challenges that will stimulate any researcher. It has an enormous global reach but very few institutions in India have been able to organize and offer courses devoted to DH. Hence your training in DH will contribute to your betterment as a researcher and also to your acceptability in the global job market, in academia as well as in certain industries.</div>

<h4 class="panel-title"><a href="#collapse3" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> What are the academic opportunities for a DH graduate?</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">It depends mostly on the background of the graduate, but courses such as digital economics, smart healthcare, and archiving and databases will prepare her for opportunities in these fields. Specialists from the relevant industries will conduct workshops here in IITJ to make students ready for the job market. Moreover, Students with sociological/anthropological background and motivation and a degree in DH will be indispensable as research assistants and that experience will contribute to their own research.</div>

</div>
<div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">DH is an emergent discipline with strong networks across the globe, many universities in the UK, USA, Australia have DH departments/centres/schools. DH graduates from IITJ may have their opportunities for doctoral and postdoctoral positions abroad, especially since more traditional Indian universities rarely prepare their students for the challenges posed by such new disciplines.</div>

<div class="panel-body">IITJ has a well-equipped Career Development Centre (CDC) with staff-members having industrial experience. It functions as a placement cell, organizes industrial events and helps students with employment opportunities. That service might be beneficial for the DH graduates as well.</div>
